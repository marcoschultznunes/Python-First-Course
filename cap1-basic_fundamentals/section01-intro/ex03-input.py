#Input => is the equivalent of Java's Scanner

var = input()
print(var)

# OBS: VSCode does not allow using scanner.
# 
# To bypass that, configure code runner to run in the terminal by doing the following:
#
# Go to File > Preference > Settings then type: run code and scroll down until you see code-runner:
# Run in terminal, There will be multiple options called "code-runner". 
# In that you can find the option mentioned below.
# just check "Whether to run code in integrated terminal" and restart vscode.
