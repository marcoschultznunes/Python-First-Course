Django documentation:
    https://docs.djangoproject.com/

The documentation recommends setting up a virtual environment for
the project. This is the equivalent of package.json in JS, or the
npm init command.

This is so we can manage the dependencies inside the project.

The module used to create and manage virtual environments is called 
venv.

===== CREATING THE VENV =====

We'll use this venv module to create the virtual environment:
    sudo apt install python3-virtualenv
    virtualenv env => creates an env folder

Them we activate (select) it:
    source env/bin/activate

While it is activated on the terminal we can install dependencies 
to it.

=> We must also gitignore the env folder
