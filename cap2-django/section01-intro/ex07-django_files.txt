Let's take a look at the files django created:

    asgi.py => We mostly not touch it, but it's purpose is to run 
    our server asynchrously

    wsgi.py => Almost same as asgi.py

    settings.py => The most important file, contains many project 
    configurations, such as database connections, templates, 
    secret key, etc.
